# Dice Roller

A simple, terminal-based dice rolling application I threw together in an afternoon!

## Usage

You can input dice rolls in the standard DND format: 3d4, 5d6, 1024d7, etc...

You can also include modifiers, such as "3d6 + 2"

The output of the dice roller is a single number, representing the value that was rolled.

However, if you want a more detailed output, including the parsed syntax tree and exact values that were rolled on each dice, you can enter the "?" command to get a detailed view of the last roll.
