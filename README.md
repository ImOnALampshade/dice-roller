# Dice Roller

A simple, terminal-based dice rolling application I threw together in an afternoon to help run a DND campaign!

## Usage

Runs on the latest Python 3, [get python here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

Run `./dice_roller.py` in a terminal of your choice.

You can input dice rolls in the standard DND format: `3d4`, `5d6`, or even something you wouldn't do in real life, like `1024d47`. You can also include modifiers, such as `3d6 + 2`, or even call functions like `max 2d20`, which give you the higher of 2 20 sided dice rolls.

Full documentation for all operators and functions available coming soon.

The output of the dice roller is a single number, representing the value that was rolled. However, if you want a more detailed output, including the parsed syntax tree and exact values that were rolled on each dice, you can enter the "?" command to get a detailed view of the last roll.
